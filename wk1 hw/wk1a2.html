	<h2>My Favorite Websites</h2>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Youtube</li>
			<li>Twitter</li>
			<li>Amazon</li>

<ol>
	<li>Out of these three, I'd would have to say that Youtube is probably the favorite</li>
	<li>When You first launch the site you are drawn in by the thumbnails, even when you are standing back.</li>
	<li>Youtube is simple, easy, quick, but it can also be cluttered and ambiguous</li>
	<li>The website can solve your needs if you need a pick-me-up, music, or how-to's if you need help</li>
	<li>The content can be fun, practical, informational, inspiring, and hilarious</li>
	<li>It is very easy to find what you need from the homepage, you can use the search bar at the top and choose a video.  When you are on a video the search bar remains and you can look for another or you can see the suggested ones on the side.</li>
	<li>It's pretty simple to browse, you can see the thumbnails and the titles of the video before you click</li>
	<li>After being on the site for a while you can feel like you have wasted a lot of time but you'll feel happy</li>
	<li>The site does offer a premium service if you don't want to see ads and it offers premium content.  I have not tried it</li>
	<li>*Instead of linking to a new website, I've added my opinion of user experience and design below</li>

</ol><hr>

	<p>Let's start with <strong id="red">Youtube</strong>,</p>
	<p>Youtube is a video sharing platform.  Depending on how much you frequent Youtube, there are two display options.  The first one you get is the light(white) theme that has a very blank background.  The second theme is more for those who rather save their eyes from strain, its the dark(dark grey) theme.  I personally use the dark theme because of the fact that you wont get as much eye strain than looking at a bright white canvas.  The themes are fairly new to youtube, and good thing that they included a dark theme for when you're watching late at night.</p>
	<p>The user experience I would say is pretty solid.  It's simple and easy to pick up.  Search in the bar at the top, hit enter, and bam you'll get results.  The design, while basic, is simple and easy to understand.  You can subscribe to channels you like and what to see more of.</p>
	
	<p>Next there's <strong id="tw">Twitter</strong>,</p>
	<p>Twitter is a social media platform.  Twitter, as the website can be very intimidating at first.  When you create a profile you are asked of your interests, then it suggests people and companies to follow.  Similar to Youtube it also has a light and dark theme, but Twitter had them earlier.  Before the changes, you could send out Tweets that only consisted of 140 characters.  You can tag people and add tags in the form of hashtags, ex. @person #partytime.  Last year they made changes to double the character limit to 280.</p>
	<p>The user experience is a little wack your first time.  You can browse and see people's posts and you could like, comment, and share that tweet.  It's open to everyone so anything you post will be seen by anyone and everyone.  The design is something to get used to, it's weird that you'll have to be scrolling up a lot to see new posts, likes, comments, and retweets.</p>

	<p>Last there's <strong id="az">Amazon</strong>,</p>
	<p>Amazon is an on-line store.  It first started selling books and has grown to sell almost anything at this point.  Sadly, no dark theme, but its not likely you're to spend a lot of time on the site.  Like in their slogan "from A to Z" they sell all a wide variety of products.  You can browse, buy, and sell on Amazon.  They have this paid subscription that you can get and it allows for most of your items to arrive in only 2 days.  </p>
	<p>The user experience on amazon is fast and streamlined.  If you need to buy something you search, add to cart, checkout, confirm information, and do a final confirmation with everything summed up.  The design is like a catalog on the homepage, but once you look for stuff you see the stuff you need to see instead of other items unrelated.</p>
